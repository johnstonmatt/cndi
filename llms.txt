# cndi

> CNDI is a framework for deploying cloud-native applications that integrates ArgoCD, Terraform, and more, to enable a seamless end-to-end GitOps workflow with interactive Template-based setup.

Use interactive pre-built Templates to deploy applications like
[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org), [Kafka](https://strimzi.io), and
[Postgres](https://cloudnative-pg.io), to your own infrastructure, on
[AWS](https://aws.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com),
[Azure](https://azure.com), or your local machine. You can even create custom
Templates to automate cluster creation for your team.
